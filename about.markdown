I'm a software developer based out of San Marcos, Texas (25 miles south of Austin).  I work at [Doctor on Demand](www.doctorondemand.com) as a backend python engineer, but I've done some work on the front end (React, Vanilla JS) as well.

I spun this blog up to track my progress on side projects, in the hopes that this will give me a little accountability to myself.

In the tradition of other developer blogs, I'll inevitably end up posting only three or four times before abandoning it.
